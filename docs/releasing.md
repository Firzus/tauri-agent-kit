# Release procedure

Only reviewed alpha releases are supported. Nothing publishes on push or merge. First publication requires the maintainer's explicit approval and registry authentication. Never paste tokens into issues, source, logs or chat.

## Public-content gate

Review `git ls-files` and the exact npm/Cargo package inventories. Only `docs/media/fixture.png` and `docs/media/fixture-results.json` are approved public demo evidence. Do not attach the entire artifacts directory. Private integrations, backups and original reports belong outside the repository, not just in gitignore. Search the staged text for private application names, personal paths and credentials before the first commit.

## Local release gate

1. Align server, instrumentation, crate and `server.json` versions. Update the changelog and release notes.
2. Run all checks from CONTRIBUTING.md, `cargo check -p tauri-plugin-agent-kit --release --locked`, `pwsh -File scripts/package-test.ps1`, `cargo package -p tauri-plugin-agent-kit --locked` and `cargo publish -p tauri-plugin-agent-kit --dry-run --locked` from a clean checkout.
3. Inspect the archives, including licenses and Rust embedded assets. Compile a separate consumer against the unpacked crate.
4. Reserve a Windows desktop and run `node scripts/live-test.mjs --require-native`. Require observed click, text and Backspace effects; a safe rejection does not satisfy this gate.
5. Review dependency licenses and security advisories. The current findings are recorded in `docs/dependencies.md`; acknowledge the informational warnings before publication. Do not silently waive findings.

## First publication

After approval, create the public `Firzus/tauri-agent-kit` repository and push reviewed history. Enable private vulnerability reporting, require the Check workflow on main, and create a `release` environment requiring maintainer approval and restricting deployment to main. Open a draft PR for the preparation branch. Mark it ready only after remote checks pass; merge through the reviewed PR.

Authenticate with npm and crates.io using the maintainer's accounts. Recheck ownership/availability of all names immediately before publication. A 404 is not a reservation. Stop on a collision. The initial version can be published locally from the reviewed, clean checkout:

```powershell
npm publish artifacts/packages/tauri-agent-kit-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz --tag alpha --access public
npm publish artifacts/packages/tauri-agent-kit-instrumentation-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz --tag alpha --access public
cargo publish -p tauri-plugin-agent-kit --locked
```

Check each command's exit status before continuing. Local bootstrap publications do not claim GitHub OIDC provenance. Create a draft prerelease from the reviewed commit and attach only those two tarballs and the matching crate. Do not upload screenshots, backups or raw logs as release attachments.

## Subsequent releases

Configure trusted publishing for both npm packages and the crate, scoped to `Firzus/tauri-agent-kit`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment `release`. npm requires a sufficiently recent npm CLI and Node; the workflow uses Node 24. Use GitHub-hosted runners. Do not enable the workflow until environment approval and publisher configuration are verified.

Manually dispatch Publish alpha on main with the exact reviewed version. It reruns checks and packaging before entering the approval-gated publishing job. The output remains a draft prerelease. No automatic version bump or stable dist-tag is applied.

Publications across registries are not atomic. If any step fails, stop, inspect which versions already exist, and publish only missing components after checking ownership and the reviewed artifacts. Do not rerun the entire workflow blindly, overwrite a version, or unpublish to hide a failed launch.

## Public installation and visibility gate

In a fresh Windows folder, install the exact npm versions from the public registry, run the installed CLI's `--version`, and run the live test using `AGENT_KIT_SERVER_ENTRY` pointing to the installed entry. Create a new Tauri consumer using the exact crates.io version and exercise its plugin. Do not use path overrides or workspace links for this final check.

Only after these checks pass, mark the GitHub prerelease visible and update the changelog status. Validate `server.json` against its referenced schema, then authenticate with `mcp-publisher login github` and run `mcp-publisher publish`. The server package's `mcpName` identifies the same GitHub namespace. Verify the resulting registry entry and exact package version. Do not describe an unregistered candidate as listed.
